# CYBEKA FINAL PROJECT DSC11 PREP YEAR 2021.
# DECIPHERING BBI AND THE ‘HUSTLER NATION’ NARRATIVE USING DATA SCIENCE.

# Business Understanding
   # Business Overview
BBI (Building Bridges Initiative) was the highlight of the 2018 handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and the former Prime Minister Raila Odinga. It came in the heat of the disputed 2017 election that was already spewing into violence. BBI taskforce was put in place to come up with recommendations on ways to harmonize existing institutions so that critical issues of focus are addressed inclusively. Since then, BBI has received support from the majority of Kenyans. However, it has also been opposed by some in and out of government. 
# Problem Statement
With both parties banking on the changes contained in the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020 which seeks to expand the Executive and Parliament, experts now say if the court of Appeal in a ruling to be issued on Friday will invalidate the High Court ruling and allow IEBC to conduct a referendum, this will lay the foundation for postponing the much-awaited elections. This is because the timelines that have been set by IEBC are so tight such that as a country we cannot afford a referendum and a general election come next year.
# Proposed solution
# cybeka main objective
We are using this project seeks to inform the public, decision makers(court of appeal), the superintendents of BBI and those opposing it if the people of Kenya are in the first place, in support of the initiative before going ahead to spend hard earned tax-payers money on matters of their little concern.
